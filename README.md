In the dynamic field of cybersecurity, the undeniable repercussions of criminal and extremist organizations heavily using the internet and social media are evident. Emphasizing the human factor and the importance of flexible training tools is imperative. Individuals and businesses engaged in cybersecurity grapple with a surge in security demands, prompting awareness and skill development. Amid the escalating cybersecurity challenges stemming from the pervasive use of online platforms, call readiness and skill enhancement have increased. Present research, though productive, lacks a unified framework, resulting in a fragmented set of threat mitigation techniques, leaving law enforcement with a disjointed toolkit. It's clear that these methods need refinement and scalability, especially regarding anti-rootkit technology, given the prevalence of rootkit-based malicious attacks. In the era of cybersecurity education and awareness, a multipurpose cybersecurity tool emerges as a vital solution, offering educators a unified and cohesive platform for the seamless integration of diverse cybersecurity technologies and concepts. This consolidation, by centralizing critical knowledge in the field, rectifies the current fragmentation in cybersecurity education, empowering individuals to attain a deeper comprehension of this vital domain. This versatile tool, prioritizing the fusion of essential security utilities, caters to learning environments, ensuring ease of use and understanding. Augmented by a meticulously crafted digital manual, it not only equips individuals with practical skills but also fosters a profound understanding of the expanding significance of cybersecurity in our rapidly digitized world. The intended result is centered on making a substantial contribution to the educational sphere within the realm of cybersecurity, with the primary aim of imparting knowledge and skills to individuals, thus fostering heightened awareness.
